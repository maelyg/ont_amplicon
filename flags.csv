FLAG NAME,DEFINITION,GREEN,ORANGE,RED,GREY
QC_FLAG, Number of starting raw reads and quality filtered reads recovered for each sample,>= 2500 starting reads & >= 800 quality filtered reads,< 2500 starting reads & >= 800 quality filtered reads,< 2500 starting reads & < 800 quality filtered reads,NA
30X DEPTH FLAG,The percentage of bases that attained at least 30X sequence coverage when mapping back to the consensus match (ie qseq),*> 90%,75-90%,< 75%,The consensus returned no blast hits
TARGET ORGANISM FLAG,Flag based on whether the consensus matched to the target organism(s) by blast homology search and the % blast identity recovered,Target organism detected and blast identity > 90%,Target organism was detected and blast identity < 90%,Target organism not detected,The consensus returned no blast hits
TARGET SIZE FLAG,Length of the consensus match (ie qseq) relative to the expected target_size,within ±20%,±20%-±40%,outside the range of ±40%,The consensus returned no blast hits
MAPPED READ COUNT FLAG,Number of reads mapping back to the consensus match (ie qseq),>= 1000,200-1000,< 200,The consensus returned no blast hits
MEAN COVERAGE FLAG,Mean read coverage of each base when mapping back to the consensus match (ie qseq),>= 500,100-500,< 100,The consensus returned no blast hits
READ LENGTH FLAG,Number of mapped reads whose lengths are at least 90% of the consensus match length,>=200,50-200,< 50,The consensus returned no blast hits
MEAN MQ FLAG,Average mapping quality of reads mapping to the consensus match,>= 30,10-30,< 10,The consensus returned no blast hits
