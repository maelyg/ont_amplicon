qseq_mapping_read_count,Reads mapped,int,Y,The number of reads mapped to this sequence. A higher read count suggests greater confidence in the sequence.
qseq_mean_depth,Mean read depth,,Y,The mean depth of reads mapped to this sequence â€“ a depth of 30X indicates high confidence in the sequence.
qseq_pc_mapping_read,Reads mapped (%),,Y,Percentage of total reads that were mapped to this sequence. This can indicate what proportion of sample material this sequence represents.
