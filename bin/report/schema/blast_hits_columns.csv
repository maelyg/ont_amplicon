qseq_mapping_read_count,Mapped read count,int,Y,The number of reads mapped to this sequence. A higher read count suggests greater confidence in the sequence.
qseq_mean_depth,Mean read depth,,Y,The mean depth of reads mapped to this sequence â€“ a depth of 30X indicates high confidence in the sequence.
qseq_pc_mapping_read,Mapped read (%),,Y,Percentage of total reads that were mapped to this sequence. This can indicate what proportion of sample material this sequence represents.
qseq_pc_depth_30X,30X depth coverage (%),,Y,Percentage of this sequence with a depth of mapped reads of 30X or greater.
30X_DEPTH_FLAG,30X depth flag,,Y,Flag is green if the 30X depth coverage percentage of this sequence is >= 90%; orange if between 75% and 90%; and red if < 75%.
MEAN_COVERAGE_FLAG,Mean read depth flag,,Y,Flag is green if the mean depth of reads mapped to this sequence is > 500; orange if between 100 and 500; and red if < 100.
MAPPED_READ_COUNT_FLAG,Mapped read count flag,,Y,Flag is green if the number of reads mapped to this sequence is > 1000; orange if between 200 and 1000; and red if < 200.
TARGET_ORGANISM_FLAG,Target organism flag,,Y,Flag is green if the preliminary homology blast search of the sequence is predicted to be >= 90% identical to the sample organism targeted; orange if predicted to be < 90% identical to the sample organism targeted; and red if it is not predicted to be the sample organism targeted.
TARGET_SIZE_FLAG,Target size flag,,Y,Flag is green if the sequence length is within 20% of the target amplicon size; orange if between 20% and 40%; and red if 40% smaller or larger than expected.
READ_COUNT_80PC_REF_LENGTH_FLAG,Mapped reads length flag,,Y,Flag is green if number of mapped reads whose lengths are at least 80% of the reference length is >=250; orange if between 100 and 250; and red if < 100.
