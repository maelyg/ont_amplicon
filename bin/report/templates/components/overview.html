<p>
  This report contains tables and plots to help interpret the results of the bioinformatics pipeline ONT-amplicon. The individual sections of the report summarise the outcomes of the different steps of the workflow (preprocessing, consensus generation, homology search against NCBI, re-mapping against the consensus for depth of coverage calculation and re-mapping to reference).
